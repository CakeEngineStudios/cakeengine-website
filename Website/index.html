      <p class = "paraghgraph_text">Cake Engine is a project designed to create a workspace where individuals can learn 
        programming along side game development for a fun, enjoyable experiance. The engine's 
        framework is designed to have a simple and fast workflow where you can complete projects
        with minimal to none knowledge of any programming / game development.
        The engine strives to be the best option for beginners while also maintaining advanced tools
        found in commercial products.

    <p class = 'paraghgraph_text'>So whats the catch?
      Well there isn't one. There are no hidden paywalls or royalities. What you make is 100% yours.
      The engine does however have a feature where you can store your project on the 'Cake Cloud'
      where your development team can directly access and work on the project. you, of course may
      choose to use a free alternative like github as the feature is built in. But if you are intrested
      in purchesing a cloud server, the link below will lead you to more information about it.
      (Donations are also greatly appreciated as support for the development of the engine!)
